# Welcome to FayePI!  

Welcome! We're glad you're here!  

## What is FayePI?  

FayePI is a "fake api". It offers API endpoints you can use to build dynamic webpages and practice AJAX requests and promises with fetch.  
  
## Fake API?
FayePI offers real endpoints that will return JSON data. What makes it "fake"? The data is just silly stuff like romantic comedies, but it's enough for practice. And the silliness makes it fun!

### I want to use FayePI for fun and practice.

That's great! We're super excited that you're here, and we want to help! Head on over to our [docs site](http://fayepi.herokuapp.com/) to read up on how to use FayePI. If you have questions, you can reach [carmalou on twitter](https://twitter.com/carmalou).  

### I want to help with FayePI

First of all, thank you! Currently FayePI is only a handful of endpoints and only returns text. We'd like to expand it to return images and maybe even other files too!  
  
We also want to expand the types of data returned. Here are ways you can help:  
  
1. Find data and add it to our data directory

2. Write endpoints for any data in the data directory that doesn't already have endpoints (we use [hapi.js](https://hapijs.com/) for our endpoints).

3. Check over our documentation and help us make FayePI even better.

4. Write code examples for beginners to help them get started.

5. Anything else you can think of!
